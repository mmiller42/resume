                I am a Senior Frontend Engineer II at SmartRent, where build
                highly secure, scalable software with Elixir/​Phoenix,
                React/​TypeScript, and React Native. I value meticulous design
                and try to always think through every possible scenario. I enjoy
                writing and reviewing especially mission-critical code such as
                database migrations that run on millions of rows.

                I have worked on several different teams at SmartRent with
                experience across the stack. I learned Elixir, Phoenix, and Ecto
                on the job, quickly learning to love the expressive, functional
                language. I learned to design complex data indexes and optimal
                queries for working with a massive, high-traffic PostgreSQL
                database with over a hundred deeply interrelated tables. Now I
                work on the SmartOps team, developing a new version of a mobile
                app for property maintenance staff. I helped design the initial
                technical specifications of the custom data sync engine, and
                designed and implemented the authentication system to allow for
                secure offline use, based on dynamic customer-controlled
                settings.

                BrightBytes improves the way millions of people around the world
                learn by making intensive research educative, engaging, and
                actionable, giving educational leaders the data to make informed
                decisions about students, staff, stakeholders, and systems and
                drive learning outcomes through a number of software platforms.
                I worked on and helped model Alchemy, our internal
                React/Redux/Webpack framework of shared data transformation
                services and configuration-driven screens that rapidly deploys
                many diverse public-facing websites to Netlify and integrates
                with our core software product, Clarity. I also developed
                modular React components in ES6 and Sass as part of a team that
                builds a shareable library of components that are used to
                establish a consistent brand across BrightBytes' various
                products.

              <p>
                I developed beautiful interfaces with React and Redux using ES6
                and establish coding standards and practices for the team. We
                focused on constructing reusable, modular UI components for a
                software suite that specializes in translating reams of complex
                data into bite-sized insights and actionables to empower
                students and school districts.

                the time, the popular library <code>date-fns-tz</code> could not
                render dates and times in non-local time zones accurately,
                especially when one region was DST and another was not. The unit
                tests were carefully designed to be deliberate and

                to CRUD methods on your model, which can in turn be automated by
                store plugins (a Postgres implementation is already built).
                Modularized, minimal, tested, and non-invasive, Autonym

                provide rich, interactive content to the user via a single-page
                application that works offline by allowing the user to
                pre-download the content and storing their assessment results in
                localStorage as well as synchronizing the data with their
                account server-side when a connection is available. Wiley CFA
                Exam Review was launched in February 2015 on the v8.1 platform.
                We built the UI with a custom jQuery framework and implemented
